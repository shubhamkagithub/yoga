    rbd_pool_app_name is a Ceph pool attribute. Moving it from conf.software.rbd to
    conf.ceph.pools as app_name. This means that conf.software.rbd.rbd_pool_app_name
    is now conf.ceph.pools.cinder.volumes.app_name and conf.software.rbd.rbd_pool_app_name_backup
    is now conf.ceph.pools.backup.app_name.
