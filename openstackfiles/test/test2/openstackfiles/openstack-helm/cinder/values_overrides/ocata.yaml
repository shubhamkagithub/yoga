# NOTE(lamt): The backup_driver name after Stein requires a full class name.
# (e.g. cinder.backup.drivers.swift.SwiftBackupDriver).
# Prior to Stein, this name was just set to the package name, e.g.
#   - cinder.backup.drivers.swift
#   - cinder.backup.drivers.ceph
#   - cinder.backup.drivers.posix
