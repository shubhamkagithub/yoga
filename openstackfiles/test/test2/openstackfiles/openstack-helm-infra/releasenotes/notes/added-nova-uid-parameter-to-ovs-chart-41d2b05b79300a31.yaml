    When running openvswitch (OVS) with DPDK enabled, vhost-user sockets are
    used to connect VMs to OVS. nova-compute needs access to those sockets in
    order to plug them into OVS. For this reason, the directory containing
    vhost-user sockets must have proper permissions. The openvswitch chart now
    sets ownership of this directory to the UID of the nova user. The OVS chart
    uses the same default as the Nova chart (42424). However, if the Nova UID
    is changed in the Nova chart in a particular deployment, it also needs to
    be changed in the OVS chart correspondingly if DPDK is used.
